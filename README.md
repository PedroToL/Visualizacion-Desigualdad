# Visualizing Inequality in Latin America
An Inequality visualization app for Latin America.
***
The following app is a compilation of interactive charts, graphs and tables that present the socioeconomic context of
 Latin America for the past twenty years, in particular regarding inequality across the region. It was created using databases from the Inter-american Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank (WB).

Every representation, be it a graph or a table, is interactive, meaning that it is possible to zoom in or out, select certain options (by clicking on its name on the legend) and characteristics, or indeed time periods, including options to visualise the evolution of selected variables throughout the time sample.

## Framework

The app was created using the plotly-dash Framework for python. This framework enables users to fully exploit the data reflected in the charts and makes a complete interactive experience. For further information visit: https://plotly.com/
